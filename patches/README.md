# Patches for External Software

A patch `<name>-*.patch` is generally for the open source software `<name>` which is added/modified by the nixpkgs overlay in `../overlays/<name>.nix.md`.
Patches for `nixpkgs` are applied in `../flake.nix`.

To create/"commit" a patch of the current directory vs its latest commit:
```bash
 git diff >.../patches/....patch
```

To test a patch against the repo in CWD, or to "check it out" to edit and then "commit" again:
```bash
 git reset --hard HEAD # destructively reset the working tree to the current commit
 patch --dry-run -p1 <.../patches/....patch # test only
 patch           -p1 <.../patches/....patch # apply to CWD
```
